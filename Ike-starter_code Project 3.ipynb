    "# REPORT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project was to determine whether the salaries of jobs listed on indeed.com were high or low paying jobs. A webscraper was used to gather the data from the website. From analysis of the data it was determined from the very limited sample size that job title was the largest indicator of whether or not a job salary would be \"high\" or \"low\". \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science is a rapidly growing field with new jobs popping up everyday. As someone entering the field, it is important for me to get an understanding of the salaries of Data Scientists. In particular I am interested in the entry and base level salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report is designed to provide insight as to what influences the salary of a Data Scientist. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The information for this project was gathered using the website indeed.com. Indeed.com is a job listing website. It contains thousands of job listings throughout different cities in the U.S. Using a webscraper, essential information about each job listing pertaining to data scientists was returned. The search was done over a range of various cities and included only listings with Data Scientist explicitly in the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the results that were returned with a salary range, an analysis was completed upon it. Using the minimum of the salary range, the median salary was taken. If the minumum of the salary range for that job was listed as below or equal to the median, it was listed as \"Low\" pay. If the job's minimum salary was listed above the median, it was listed as \"High\" pay. The minimum of the range was chosen as it is more reflectie of my job search. High ends of the salary range are also possibly inflated to attract more applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The most accurate modeling method for determination of whether a job listing would be listed was a gradient boosting classifier. It returned a cross-validation score of 69% + or - 9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore it was determined using this model to classify the feature importance. The results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature ranking:\n",
    "1. feature 11 (0.408454) Job Title\n",
    "2. feature 2 (0.078572) GA\n",
    "3. feature 0 (0.073335) CA\n",
    "4. feature 4 (0.070363) MA\n",
    "5. feature 9 (0.065042) TX \n",
    "6. feature 8 (0.054161) PA\n",
    "7. feature 6 (0.053367) NJ\n",
    "8. feature 7 (0.050387) NY\n",
    "9. feature 5 (0.050384) MD\n",
    "10. feature 1 (0.038532) DC\n",
    "11. feature 10 (0.033753) VA\n",
    "12. feature 3 (0.023649) IL\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature 11 corresponds to the job title. The other features correspond to different cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The model decided that job title accounted for 40% of the feature importance.  The higher the feature is in the tree, the more it contributes to the end result. They contribute to a larger fraction of the samples in the tree. The higher the contribution, the higher the feature importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very sensible result. It states that job title is a prime indicator of salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately this data set was not the largest. Of the thousands of jobs scraped from indeed, only about one hundred had actual salary data. A much larger sample size would have allowed for more accurate results. With a larger data set more detailed and powerful predictions could have been made. A determination of a salary range as opposed to a \"high\" or \"low\" salary might have been possible. \n"
